 * Project to take the ESP504 radio move it to the US 222 amateur 
 * band.  The 2022 code (see elsewhere in the project) was minimally
 * working but really needs to be completely re-written.  
 * Additionally decent functions for the PLL needed to be written 
 * then and that's still true today.
 * Plus the A register for the PLL is 63/64 and that's it.
